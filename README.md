# .github

Default community health files for repositories owned by dflippojr. GitHub applies them to any repository that doesn't have its own. A repository's own `.github` files take precedence over these, file by file.

## Contents

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md`: template for features and changes (Outcome, Background, Scope, Decisions, Open questions, Dependencies, Acceptance criteria).
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md`: template for bug reports.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/verification.md`: template for confirming something already built works.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`: new-issue chooser settings.
- `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: default pull request description.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: how issues, labels, branches and pull requests work, including how to write an issue.
- `labels.json`: the shared label set.
- `scripts/sync_labels.py`: shows or applies label differences across repositories. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- `tests/`: tests for the label script (`python -m unittest discover tests`).
